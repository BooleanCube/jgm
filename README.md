# Java Graphics Math and Physics Library
> Java Library for Computer Graphics Math/Physics. Math and Physics tools for 2D graphic applications.

I have been developing many games using Unity and other popular game engines. However, I have recently started thinking about creating my own game engine which inspired this project to come into play. JGMP is a math and physics library written in Java for any Java Graphics Engine Developers including myself to aid in their development.
