# Java Graphics Math and Physics Library
> Java Library for Computer Graphics Math/Physics. Math and Physics tools for 2D graphic applications.

I have been developing many games using Unity and other popular game engines. However, I have recently started thinking about creating my own game engine which inspired this project to come into play. JGMP is a math and physics library written in Java for any Java Graphics Engine Developers including myself to aid in their development.

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

## Features
- 2D Vectors
- 2D Shapes (2D Circle, 2D Rectangle, 2D Ray)
- 2D Collision Check Helper (collision checking between 2 shapes)
- Float Mathematics Helper
- Kinematics and Dynamics Models
- Universal Gravity Force Model
- Object Velocity Model

## Documentation
`com/boole/math/helpers/` contains many helpful tools and utilities (float management and collision detection) <br>
`com/boole/math/shapes/` contains many shape models with useful utilities. <br>
`com/boole/math/vectors/` contains vector math model with a lot of vector mathematics and linear algebra functions. <br>
`com/boole/physics/` contains many useful 2D kinematics models for 2d game physics.

You can learn more about the library through the [documentation](https://booleancube.github.io/projects/jgmp/main.html)
You can also find a simple wiki page [here](https://github.com/BooleanCube/jgmp/wiki)
